# **SuaveOS**

This is an operating system created specifically to run live on a USB or similar medium. The idea was to create a system that could automatically set up persistent memory, as well as be low in resource consumption so that it could be run anywhere, and at any time. 

## **Important Basic Information**

1. In the `~/SuaveOS` directory of the operating system, the file `Changes.md` holds information about the customizations and changes made to Debian that makes SuaveOS what it is.

2. `sudo auto-persistence` executes a shell script that automates the process to set up persistent memory with some imput from the user. 

3. `suave` is the default username.
